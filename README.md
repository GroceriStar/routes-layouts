Main purpose for this project is to figure out how to make routes, route-config and layouts logic works together
and don't navigate via our projects....
using react router 4, using https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/tree/master/packages/react-router-config
, https://medium.com/@albertcito/different-layouts-with-react-router-1311a21a2df5

we also have 2 ui libraries - reactstrap & antd
because we still not sure which is we'll use for all of our projects, so we'll try to make our logic create in order to please both of this libs.

and we'll try to incorporate logic of connecting this stuff to our server, later.




- we should have a nested routes for sure


- they also should be separated by layouts and by main logic of components


- and we should implement a login-like routes approach...
